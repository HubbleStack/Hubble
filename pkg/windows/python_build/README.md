# Build Python 3.9.2 For FIPS

## Open a CMD terminal
```
powershell.exe -noexit -file build_python.ps1
```

## Note
Currently, this script expects few files in current folder only.
Files:
- build.bat
- fips_python.patch

So, the script has to be run from current folder only.
```
/hubble/pkg/windows/python_build/
```
