# For deployment purposes, it's typical to have a default
# corporate config /etc/hubble/hubble that you're not meant to
# alter.
#
# Installers should then create a section like this in
# /etc/hubble.d/filenamehere.conf
#
# Each section listed in such .conf files completely replaces the
# section listed in /etc/hubble
#
# Side note: each .conf file will replace the sections in the
# .conf files loaded before it. The order of such applications is
# undefined, so it's best to limit the number of these files.
#
# Side note: if more than one endpoint is listed, they will be
# tried in order until one works. Hubble does not attempt to send
# events to more than one endpoint.
