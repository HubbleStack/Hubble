        but in the interests of being able to customize its behavior for hubble purposes

        Note that the linux itimers/signals/SIGALRM method of timeouts was a
        heckuvalot more time accurate. the timeout here is more like a loose
        suggestions than an actual timeout in the sense that timeout=600s is
        really more like 600Â±20s -- this is noted in the stopit docs too.
